# Add service messages here. All properties in this file must be prefixed with "ser" 
# followed by a 3 digit number.
#
# Valid suffixes for the message codes include message, action, type, options and errornumber
# message: Mandatory and must include the text for the message indicating what the message is for. 
#          It can include parameters identified using {0} syntax with the first parameter numbered
#          0, the next 1, etc.
# action:  Optional and if specified should state what actions the user should perform in response
#          to the message. 
# type:    Indicates the message type. It is optional (default is PLAIN), but if specified, it must 
#          be one of PLAIN, INFORMATION, WARNING, ERROR, QUESTION_YES_NO, QUESTION_YES_NO_CANCEL or
#          QUESTION_OK_CANCEL. A description for each type is also included in this properties file. 
#          The localized description can be used as the title in the message dialog that is 
#          displayed to the user. 
# options: Specifies a list of button labels to be used when displaying the message dialog. By default
#          the buttons to display are determined from the message type, however that list can be
#          overriden with values in this property. Note that each button label must be separated by
#          a comma with no space in between. e.g. ...options=Opt1,Opt2,Cancel  
# errornumber: Flag to indicate the error number generated by the system should be displayed 
#              appended to the message. 
#
# Use \ to escape a character (e.g. \. to add full stop). \ can also be used to extend a message 
# over more than one line. Note that white space at beginning of the new line us gobbled up to 
# the first character. 

# Unit test messages - These do not need to be transferred to other locale message files.
